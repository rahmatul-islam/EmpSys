\title{\textbf{NoteX – Collaborative Learning System}\\
Project Proposal}

\section{Problem Analysis and Motivation}
In the modern academic environment, students often face difficulties in organizing and sharing their notes.  
\begin{itemize}
    \item Notes are usually stored in different formats and locations.  
    \item Files may get lost, and repeated sharing becomes inefficient.  
    \item There is no central system dedicated to note sharing and searching.  
\end{itemize}

Therefore, we propose \textbf{NoteX – Collaborative Learning System}, where students can upload, search, download, and delete their notes in an organized platform. This will enhance collaborative learning among students.

\section{Literature Review}
There are existing platforms such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive which allow file storage and sharing. However, these are generic platforms, not specifically designed for student note sharing.  
Learning Management Systems (LMS) like Moodle and Blackboard provide advanced functionalities but are often too complex for simple note sharing.  
Hence, a lightweight, student-friendly system is necessary, focusing solely on \textbf{note sharing and collaborative learning}.  

\section{Methodology}
The proposed system will consist of the following modules:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Login System:} Students log in with a username and password.
    \item \textbf{Upload Notes:} Students upload PDF or text files into a dedicated directory.
    \item \textbf{Search Notes:} Search functionality based on filenames or keywords.
    \item \textbf{Download Notes:} Students can download existing notes.
    \item \textbf{Delete Notes:} Students can delete their own uploaded notes.
\end{itemize}

\section{Feasibility Study}
\subsection{Economic Feasibility}
The system requires no additional cost since free tools (Java, SQLite) will be used.  

\subsection{Technical Feasibility}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Frontend: Java Swing (for GUI).  
    \item Backend: File System / SQLite database.  
    \item Easily expandable and beginner-friendly.  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Operational Feasibility}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Simple dashboard with intuitive buttons.  
    \item Easy to learn and use for students.  
\end{itemize}

\section{Main Phases}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Requirement specification.  
    \item System design (DFD and UML diagrams).  
    \item Implementation in Java.  
    \item Testing and debugging.  
    \item Deployment and report preparation.
    \end{enumerate}
